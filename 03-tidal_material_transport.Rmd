In this study, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) were employed as a key instrument to determine the speed and direction of water movement at various depths and CTD profilers were utilized to measure conductivity, temperature, and depth. Two mooring ADCPs were deployed from August 14th, 2023 - November 10th, 2023 simultaneously with CTD sensors along the Penobscot River in Bangor, Maine. ADCP 1 is deployed upstream of ADCP 2 where they sit at depths of -5 meters and -10 meters respectively. CTD 1 is deployed upstream of ADCP 1. CTD 2 is deployed between ADCP 1 and ADCP 2. CTD 3 is deployed downstream of ADCP 2.

The primary focus of the ADCP measurements was to quantify barotropic overtides and overtides in current velocities, enabling the exploration of complex interactions among tidal constituents. Additionally, the ADCPs were instrumental in calibrating measurements of turbidity using acoustic backscatter. By relating turbidity data to suspended sediment concentrations, this non-intrusive approach offered valuable insights into the dynamics of material transport in estuarine environments. The combination of ADCP current velocity measurements and acoustic backscatter analyses played a crucial role in investigating the impact of tidal non-linearities on sediment dynamics, contributing essential knowledge to estuarine ecosystem management and coastal resilience.

### Sampling Design

A harmonic analysis was ran using the T-Tide in MATLab to understand the diurnal effects in study area to determine sampling time. Harmonic analysis showed that the diurnal tide effects are significant in the study area during the time of deployment and because of this, two sampling dates were chosen where sampling will take place every hour for 12 hours to account for the rising and falling tide phase of the diurnal high tide during the dry and wet seasons. This sampling design will allow us to capture the seasonal diurnal effects on the tide and suspended sediment in the Penobscot River estuary throughout the ADCP deployment. 

- Harmonic Analysis results?

During each of these sampling events, suspended sediment samples will be collected using the nisken bottle, and turbidity, salinity, depth, and temperature measurements will be recorded using the eureka probe. Three samples will be taken at the surface, middle, and bottom of the water column for each location of the ADCPs for a total of nine samples at each location for each sampling event. This will create a vertical transect profile of the water column showing the suspended sediment concentrations which will be used to calibrate the suspended sediment concentrations to the ADCP acoustic backscatter measurements.

### Analyses
- suspended sediment samples processed in the lab using vacuum filtering and oven drying process to calculate the weight of suspended sediments in each water sample. This process also gave the organic/inorganic ratio for each sediment sample.
- wavelet analysis of ADCP data to understand M4 oscillations and their contribution to subtidal flows and material transport during wet and dry seasons

### Calibration
- Methods for calibrating acoustic backscatter from ADCPs to suspended sediment concentration based on the field samples collected.
  - may have to correct for spread, frequency and bin depth? 
  - equations used?
